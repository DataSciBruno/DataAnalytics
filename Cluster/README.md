# Clustering Analysis
This project focuses on performing clustering analysis on stock price data. We will be using the yfinance library to retrieve historical stock prices, and then applying clustering techniques to identify patterns and group similar stocks together.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

yfinance
pandas
plotly.express
scipy
statsmodels.api
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
You can install these dependencies using pip:

## Data Collection
The first step is to retrieve the historical stock price data using the yfinance library. You will be prompted to enter the ticker symbol of the stock and the start and end dates for the data. For example:

## Data Preprocessing
We will perform some data preprocessing steps to calculate additional columns such as 'Gap', 'Pct_Change', and 'Close_vs_Open'. These columns represent the opening gap values, percentage change in the closing price, and the percentage difference between the closing and opening prices, respectively.

## Clustering Analysis
The main objective of this project is to apply clustering techniques to the preprocessed stock price data. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their characteristics.

We will use various clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to identify distinct clusters in the stock price data. These clusters can help us gain insights into similarities and differences among stocks.

## Results and Visualization
The final step is to analyze and visualize the results of the clustering analysis. We can use various visualization techniques such as scatter plots, heatmaps, or dendrograms to present the clustered data.

Additionally, we can calculate and compare statistics such as mean, median, or standard deviation of specific features within each cluster.

## Conclusion
Clustering analysis provides a powerful approach to identify patterns and group stocks based on their price characteristics. This project aims to demonstrate the application of clustering techniques on stock price data and provide insights into the relationships among stocks.

Feel free to explore the provided code and modify it according to your requirements. Have fun experimenting with different clustering algorithms and visualizations to gain valuable insights from stock price data!
