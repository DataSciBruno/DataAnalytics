# Descriptive Analysis
This project focuses on performing descriptive analysis on stock price data. We will be using the yfinance library to retrieve historical stock prices and analyze various aspects of the data.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

yfinance
pandas
plotly.express
scipy
statsmodels.api
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
You can install these dependencies using pip:

## Data Collection
The first step is to retrieve the historical stock price data using the yfinance library. You will be prompted to enter the ticker symbol of the stock and the start and end dates for the data. For example:

## Data Visualization
We will use various visualization techniques to gain insights into the stock price data. The plotly.express and matplotlib.pyplot libraries will be used to create visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, and bar plots.

## Support and Resistance Levels
We will identify support and resistance levels in the stock price data. Support levels represent the price level at which the stock tends to stop falling and start rising, while resistance levels represent the price level at which the stock tends to stop rising and start falling.

The project will identify local minima as support levels and local maxima as resistance levels. These levels will be plotted on a line plot to visualize their positions in the stock price data.

## Conclusion
Descriptive analysis provides valuable insights into stock price data by analyzing various aspects of the data. This project aims to demonstrate the application of descriptive analysis techniques on stock price data, including data visualization and identification of support and resistance levels.

Feel free to explore the provided code and modify it according to your requirements. Have fun analyzing and gaining insights from stock price data!
